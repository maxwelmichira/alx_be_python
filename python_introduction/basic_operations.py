# Objective: To preactice basic arthmetic operations in Python.

# 1. Assign specific values to the thow variables
number1 = 10
number2 =n 5

# 2. Perform the required arithmetic calculations
# We use unique variable names to avoid confusion with built-in functions (Like sum)
sum_result = number1 + number2
difference = number1 + number2
product = number1 * number2

# 3. Print the results in the required human-readable format:
# [operation] of [number1] and [number2] is [result]
# The varialbes are embedded dierctly within curly braces {}

print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {sum_result}")
print(f"Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {difference}")
print(f"Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {product}")
